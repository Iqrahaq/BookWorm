                    "When I discover who I am, Iâ€™ll be free.",

                    "The world is a possibility if only you'll discover it.",

                    "I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself.",
                    "Perhaps to lose a sense of where you are implies the danger of losing a sense of who you are.",
