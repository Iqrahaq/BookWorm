## Current Status

**This project is now closed and bookworm bot is no longer supported.**

## Usage, Commands & Features

**Command Prefix = "bw!"**

**bw!ping** - Returns my response time in milliseconds.

**bw!info** - Returns information about me.

**bw!botsetup** - If I'm new, use this command to create the required role and entries in my system.

**bw!bookworms** - Lists the current book club members and their book club information.

**bw!topfive** - Lists the top 5 book worms (book club members).

## Future Implementations

**Paginating bw!bookworms list** - Not all the bookworms show, so the fix for that at the moment is bw!profile. The plan is to hopefully paginate bw!bookworms to show the full list.

**Docker Image** - A docker image for simple and easy deployment should exist.
